# HOTEL SOLUTIONS   

API for the management of hotel rooms and reservations.

In this project, no third-party libraries or dependencies will be used to facilitate certain solutions, such as `django-simple-history` for a log record system or `django-storages` for storing different files.

## Applications
- [Account](#account)
- [Hotel](#hotel)

### Account
Manages the records of various users throughout the project in the database, as well as the different methods this application may need to work with the records.

### Hotel
Store the various hotel and room records along with their information, including media content, in a database using the different methods that this application may require.

## UML
**NOTE:** Please note that this is a simplified representation, and actual models might be more complex depending on your application's requirements. You can inspect the database schema generated by running `makemigrations` and `migrate` commands to see the exact table names and relationships in a real Django project.
