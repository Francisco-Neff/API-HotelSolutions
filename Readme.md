# HOTEL SOLUTIONS   

API-Rest for the management of hotel rooms and reservations.

In this project, no third-party libraries or dependencies will be used to facilitate certain solutions, such as `django-simple-history` for a log record system or `django-storages` for storing different files. 

For controlling the application in various views, the `is_staff` and `is_superuser` fields of the Account model will be used, temporarily setting aside the permissions and access provided by Django itself.
